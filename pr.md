# Pull requests

This page is really WIP


## Making a pull request to someone else's repo

Open repo on github

Fork with button in github top corner

Clone YOUR repo not the original

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOURusername/reponame
```

Edit, add, commit, push

Click link in `git push` output


Clarification from chat with arrinao:

```
<Arrinao> I don't know what this is
<Arrinao> Clone YOUR repo not the original
<Arrinao> It's been a long time since I've done stuff on other person's repo
<Akuli> should be:  your fork
<Arrinao> I think only once
<Akuli> :)(
<Akuli> :)
<Arrinao> with ThePhilgrim's minesweeper
<Akuli> and in that repo, you had push permission
<Akuli> so you just cloned it and committed and pushed, as if it was your repo
<Arrinao> can you tell the whole sequence?
<Arrinao> navigate to other person's repo
<Akuli> anyway, with "YOUR repo", i meant https://github.com/Arrinao/git-guide
<Arrinao> click fork
<Akuli> yeah
<Akuli> that will create https://github.com/Arrinao/git-guide
<Akuli> (notice Arrinao)
<Akuli> so now you have your own git-guide repo, the fork
<Arrinao> ok
<Akuli> and you clone this fork instead of cloning my git-guide, then you commit and push to this fork
```
